  The value here is what 
  you supply with the --commit option when invoking the OpenShift `oc start-build` command.
  It allows you to point the OpenShift build to a specific commit hash from the git-log of the
  source repository.  If you do 
  not supply a value, the plugin assumes the latest version from the source repository should 
  be used.
