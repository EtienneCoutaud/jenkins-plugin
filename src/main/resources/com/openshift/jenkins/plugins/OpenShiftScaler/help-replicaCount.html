<div>
  The value here should be the number of started pods desired for the deployment specified. It is the 
  equivalent of the value supplied to --replicas with an `oc scale` command invocation. This is a required parameter. 
  If an integer is not specified here, this build step can not be added to the job. 
  Note: specifying a 0 is allowed, and means you do not want any pods for the specified deployment config running.
