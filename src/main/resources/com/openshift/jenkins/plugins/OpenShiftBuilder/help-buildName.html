  The value here is what 
  you supply with the --from-build option when invoking the OpenShift `oc start-build` command.
  It allows you to point to OpenShift build to a previously run build, and run another build
  with exactly the same source and destination metadata.  If you do 
  not supply a value, the plugin will generate a new OpenShift build based on the Build Configuration 
  referenced.
